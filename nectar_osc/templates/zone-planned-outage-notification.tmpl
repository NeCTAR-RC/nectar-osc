This email is to inform you of a scheduled availability zone outage to the
Nectar esearch Cloud.
{% include 'schedule.frag' %}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
A {% if days > 0 %}{{ days }} day {% elif hours > 0 %}{{ hours }} hour {% else %} short {% endif %}
outage is required to perform essential maintenance on cloud infrastructure in
{% if zones|length == 1 -%}
the {{ zones[0] }} availability zone. (Only instances in this zone will be
directly affected.)
{% else -%}
the following availability zones:
{{ ", ".join(zones) -}}. (Only instances in these zones will be directly
affected.)
{% endif -%}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<br>
Affected compute and database instances will be shut down and will be
inaccessible during the outage. (Note: instances will <b>not</b> be destroyed.)
In addition, the zone(s) will be offline during the outage period and
management requests (e.g. 'reboot', 'resize' and 'snapshot') in the zone
will not work.
<br>
<br>
If this outage is too distruptive, you may have the option of relocating
instances to other availability zones prior to the outage start.  (This
is subject to availability of capacity, and to any restrictions on the
AZs that your project is permitted to use.)  Note that relocation will
involve prior planning on your part, will take significant time and effort,
and is not entirely without risk. Please refer to the Nectar documentation
on "Migrating Instances between Nectar Availability Zones" and related
Nectar Tutorials.
{% if affected -%}
<br>
<br>
Your instances that will affected by this outage are listed below.
{% endif -%}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Actions reequired</h2>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    We recommend that you perform your own backups, take compute instance
    snapshots or otherwise save copies of important data somewhere other
    than the affected availability zones.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once backups are complete, we recommended that you detach volumes and
    then shut down all affected compute instances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please ensure that the above actions are completed before the scheduled
    outage start time.  If you are unable to do this, we will shut down
    the compute instances that are still running.  We won't take backups
    for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the outage, you will need to manually start up your affected compute
    instances and reattach any volumes that you detached.
  </li>
</ul>
