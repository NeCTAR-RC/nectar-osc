This email is to inform you of a scheduled networking outage affecting the
ARDC Nectar Research Cloud.
{% include 'schedule.frag' %}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
A {% if days > 0 %}{{ days }} day {% elif hours > 0 %}{{ hours }} hour {% else %} short {% endif %}
outage is required to perform essential network in
{% if zones|length == 1 -%}
the {{ zones[0] }} availability zone.
{% else -%}
the following availability zones:
{{ ", ".join(zones) -}}.
{% endif -%}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
This outage will impact on your ability to access instances and databases in the affected zone
or zones.  It may also affect their ability to contact each other.  The instances and databases
should recover automatically when outage is over.
<br>
<br>
{% if affected -%}
<br>
<br>
Your instances in the affected availability zone(s) are listed below.
{% endif -%}
<br>
<br>
<h2>Actions Required</h2>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    We recommend that you perform your own backups, snapshots or otherwise save
    copies of important data somewhere other than the affected availability zones.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the outage, you should not attempt to perform management operations
    on your instances, volumes or databases in the affected zone, using the
    Nectar Dashboard, OpenStack CLI tools or OpenStack APIs.  Rebooting your
    instances won't help.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the outage, we advise that you connect to your instances, and check
    that services running on them have recovered.  Also check that any
    outward-facing services you are running are working correctly,
    and that your loadbalancers are healthy.
  </li>
</ul>
